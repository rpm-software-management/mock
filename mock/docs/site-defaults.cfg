#
# '<pm_pfx>_install_command' (e.g. dnf5_install_command) - when
#       'use_bootstrap' is enabled, these commands are used to install the
#       desired package manager (providing the '<pm_pfx>_command' file) into
#       the "bootstrap" chroot;  for installing it, Mock first tries to find
#       '<pm_pfx>_command' on host, and then if not found there is a
#       pre-defined fallback so Mock tries other host's managers (dn5
#       => dnf => yum, etc.).  But installing the bootstrap chroot might not
#       be an easy task in some cases (e.g. installing modern Fedora bootstrap
#       where packages are Zstd-compressed with the old Yum from RHEL 7).  You
#       might want to use 'use_bootstrap_image' instead (then bootstrap chroot
#       is just "downloaded", not installed).
#
# '<pm_pfx>_disable_plugins (e.g. dnf_disable_plugins) - list of package
#       manager plugins that should be always disabled when Mock executes the
#       '<pm_pfx>_command' (e.g. versionlock, with Mock we always want to build
#       against the latest package versions available in buildroot)
#
# '<pm_pfx>_builddep_command (e.g. yum_builddep_command) - normally,
#       the '<pm_pfx>_command builddep' command is used by default to install
#       build dependencies.  There's no 'yum builddep' (sub)command though,
#       but /bin/yum-builddep.  Use this option to override the default.
#
# '<pm_pfx>_builddep_opts (e.g. dnf_builddep_opts) - list of additional
#       options to always use with the builddep command

# The `repo_arch` (read-only) option simplifies DNF configuration with Mock for

# architecture for a given Mock config (for cross-arch builds, bootstrap uses a
# different architecture than the target chroot!). However, `$basearch` often
# doesn't work correctly — some distributions do not align the mirror URLs with
# the `$basearch` content (as known by DNF), causing problems with
# cross-distro/cross-architecture builds.  The `repo_arch` internal is then
# exported as a `{{ repo_arch }}` Jinja2 placeholder, aiming to help with this
# problem.  Simply replace `$basearch` with `{{ repo_arch }}` in your config.
#
# The `repo_arch` thing is not really an "option" but rather a Mock internal
# exported for read-only use-cases.  However, the `repo_arch_map` dictionary
# can be used to affect Mock's background decisions.  For example, when
# the configuration claims `target_arch=armv7hnl`, but the repo URLs look like
# 'example.com/arm32/', one can use
#       `baseurl=example.com/{{ repo_arch }}/` instead of
#       `baseurl=example.com/$basearch/`, together with
#       `config_opts["repo_arch_map"] = {"armv7hnl": "arm32"}`.
# In such a case, builds on `x86_64` hosts will expand to `example.com/x86_64`
# URL for the bootstrap (native) chroot installation, but also to
# `example.com/arm32` for the target (cross-arch, emulated) chroot
# installation.
