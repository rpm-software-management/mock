# Work in progress...

When you plan to release a new mock-core-configs for a new Fedora version being
branched from Rawhide, there's a script in releng/rawhide-branching.sh that
helps you to setup a correct configuration layout.

A note on mock versions: 

  There are now two main branches to be aware of:
    - mock-1.0 (pre-F13 and EPEL5)
    - mock-1.3 (EPEL6)
    - main (for releasing and development, F-13+ and EPEL7+)
  Please be careful when
  updating the various distro to use the correct branch and version
  number when generating tarfiles for RPM generation.

=====================================================================

Release checklist overview:

0) change to the local main
   $ git checkout main
1) fetch git remotes and fast-forward your local main
   $ git pull --rebase main
2) install snapshot version
   $ tito build --rpm -i
3) run the testsuite, and fix any reported failures
   It's strongly discouraged to run the testsuite locally, because certain
   system configuration is needed.  Please allocate some disposable VM, and run
   the testsuite there.  The system can be preconfigured using the Ansible
   playbook provided here.  Play it like `./integration-tests/setup-box`.
   Then just:
      $ ssh root@<IP_ADDRESS_OF_TESTED_MACHINE>
      # su - mockbuild
      $ cd mock/behave
      $ behave # new testsuite
      $ cd ../mock # old testsuite
      $ make check 1>/tmp/test-output.txt  2>&1
4) tag the git tree:
   $ tito tag
   When you release both mock and mock-core-configs together, you
   likely want to (a) first tag 'mock-core-configs' package with bumped
   'Requires: mock >= ??', (b) bump 'Conflicts: mock-core-configs < ??' in
   mock.spec and (c) then tag new mock version.
5) push to main git repo (only from main branch):
   $ git push
   $ git push --tags
6) release for EPEL and Fedora
   $ git checkout main
   # make sure that .tito/releasers.conf is up to date
   $ tito release fedora-git-all
7) publish tgz
   $ tito build --tgz
   Go to:
   https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/releases
   Click Draft new release
   Choose existing tag. E.g., mock-1.4.9-1 @ main
   Enter the same tag as release title.
   Attach the binary.
8) Prepare release notes. And add list of contributed authors:
   git log mock-1.4.8-1.. --format="%aN" | sort |uniq

Once the builds finish (successfully) you should push the just built
packages to their respective testing repositories. This can be done
either with the Bodhi WebUI at
https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/ or if there are no other
package dependencies, using the 'fedpkg update' command. 
Note that you do not need to do this for the main (rawhide) branch
since it automatically gets pushed to testing.
