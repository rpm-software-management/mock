Scripts
-------

'setup-box.sh' - This script is meant to prepare everything for successful
        testsuite run.  It installs `mockbuilder` user, adds it into the
        'mock' group, installs necessary packages etc.  On top of that, it
        executes the scripts in this directory.

'prepare-user.sh' - This script is meant to be executed right after creating
        a new separate user for testing mock.  Typically:
            useradd testuser
            usermod -a -G mock testuser
            su - testuser
            $ ./prepare-user.sh

'prepare-lvm.sh' - The script creates /test-lvm-disk file and loop device from
        that file to be used as lvm storage.  You'll need this to execute this
        as root before running 20-lvm-plugin.tst.
