## Mock 2.12 bugfixes:

This is rather a small bugfix release, the most interesting stuff has been done
in mock-core-configs package (see below).

 * We don't set --cwd for --shell mode when a systemd-nspawn without the
   `--chdir` option is installed on the sytem (typically el7)

 * An RPM `addMacro()` traceback fixed.  The SCM plugin was fixed to explicitly
   convert the configured macro macro values (in e.g.
   `config_opts['macros']['%_platform_multiplier'] = 10`) to strings.
   [[PR 753][PR#753]]

 * Explicitly disabled versionlock DNF plugin by default, as we don't want to
   affect the builds. [[PR 747][PR#747]]

 * Mock package requirement on `shadow-utils` was removed from
   `mock-core-configs` to proper `mock-filesystem`. [[PR 743][PR#743]]


## Mock-core-configs v34.6:

 * CentOS Stream 9 "preview" files added

 * Rocky Linux configs added

 * AlmaLinux 8 AArch64 configs added.

 * Add AlmaLinux Devel repo as an optional repo for AlmaLinux 8.

 * Fixed GPG key path for SLE updates in openSUSE Leap 15.3.
