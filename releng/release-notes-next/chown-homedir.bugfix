In the [issue#1257][] it was suggested that we do not change recursively
ownership every run. This was implemented and landed in Mock 5.5.
But in the [issue#1364][] we found that for fresh chroots the homedir
is not writable for unpriv user.
We changed the behaviour that ownership of homedir is changed always (that was
a behaviour prior 5.5 release) and the ownership is changed recursively only for
rebuilds.
