The mechanism for creating the `mock` group has been fixed again on Fedora/RHEL,
because the built-in RPM user creation mechanism only works on F42 and newer.
Older versions still require `%pre`.

The `mock-core-configs` package files were previously owned by the `mock` group,
same as a few files in `mock` package â€” which was unnecessary.  These files are
intended to be read-only and accessible by anyone.  This issue was actually
[causing install-order problems][issue#1588] when `mock-core-configs` or `mock`
was installed before `mock-filesystem`.  So newly those files have the default
`0644, root, root` ownership.
