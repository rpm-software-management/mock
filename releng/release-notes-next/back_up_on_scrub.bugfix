`mock --scrub=all` now correctly backs up successful builds from the buildroot. Fixes issue #1639.

The backup process now uses `mv` semantics instead of `cp`, avoiding file duplication,
preserving timestamps, and improving performance. Gemini Code Assist flagged the
use of `util.run` as unsafe, so it was replaced with `os.replace` to safely overwrite
existing files.

Improve logs and comments in backup_build_results for clarity.
