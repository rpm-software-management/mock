Per the approved [Fedora 40 change](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/BuildWithDNF5),
[we switched][PR#1332] the default `package_manager` configuration
for Fedora 40 or newer to `dnf5`.
This was previously done when Fedora 40 was Rawhide,
but it [regressed][rhbz#2264535] when Fedora 40 branched.
