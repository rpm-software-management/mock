This release include fix with Python 3.14 incompatibility. [#1594](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/issues/1594)

Mock refused to start as non-root user with Python 3.14. This was because of the change in behaviour of ProcessPoolExecutor in Python.
The code was altered to work with both old and new Python.
