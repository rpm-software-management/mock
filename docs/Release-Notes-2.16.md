Released on XXX.

## Mock-core-configs 36.4

The biggest change is the removal of `epel-8-*` configs. It has been replaced by several configs: `alma+epel-8-*`, `centos+epel-8-*`, `oraclelinux+epel-8-*`, `rhel+epel-8-*`, `rocky+epel-8-*`. Every config has its pros and cons:

* `alma+epel-8-*` - This uses Alma Linux 8 + Fedora EPEL. It works right off the bat and it is recommended replacement. The only disadvantage is that Koji actually uses RHEL + EPEL for EPEL builds.
* `centos+epel-8-*` - This uses CentOS 8 + Fedora EPEL. We do **not** recommend to use this config, because [CentOS 8 will reach EOL on December 31, 2021](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/) and will be removed from mirrors on January 31, 2022.
* `oraclelinux+epel-8-*` - This uses Oracle Linux 8 + Fedora EPEL.
* `rhel+epel-8-*` - This uses RHEL 8 + Fedora EPEL. This is the configuration that Koji uses. But it [requires some settings](Feature-rhelchroots) and RHEL subscriptions. As developer, you can have [16 subscriptions for free](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/10/how-to-activate-your-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux-subscription).
* `rocky+epel-8-*` - This uses Rocky Linux 8 + Fedora EPEL. It works right off the bat and it is recommended replacement. The only disadvantage is that Koji actually uses RHEL + EPEL for EPEL builds.

There were [several options how to handle EOL of epel-* configs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF7-7_y6Ac_oB-kCFdE6VBWPW8o8zjXd2Z0SGy4VxUA/edit?usp=sharing) and we asked EPEL Steering Committee to decide and they [decided to remove epel-* config](https://pagure.io/epel/issue/133#comment-765381). So it is up to you to decide what to use.

Mock will ease it and if you try to build for `epel-8-*` config and this config does not exist, you will get this message:

 * Added compatibility symlinks for EPEL 7 to centos+epel-7-*
 * Resolved the multiple "local" repo problems
 * Dropped rhel+epel-8-ppc64 config
 * Added rhel+epel-8-s390x config
 * Added navy-8-x86_64 config
 * Reduced packages installed in epel chroots

## Mock 2.16 changes:

Mock got a new configuration option:

```
config_opts["no-config"]["epel-8"] = {}
config_opts["no-config"]["epel-8"]["alternatives"] = {
    "alma+epel-8": {
        "description": [
            "Builds against AlmaLinux 8 repositories, "
            "together with the official EPEL repositories.",
            "Project page: https://almalinux.org/"
        ],
    }
    }
```

When the configuration file for `epel-8-*` does not exist, it will print the text from the `description` field.
There is new file `/etc/mock/chroot-aliases.cfg` which contains defaults, but you can add your own option in your user config.

There was one issue with BSD Tar, which has been resolved [[GH#820](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/pull/820)]

There is new option `ssl_extra_certs` [[GH#801](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/pull/801)]

```
config_opts['ssl_extra_certs'] = ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/client.crt', '/etc/pki/tls/certs/',
                                  '/etc/pki/tls/private/client_nopass.key.crt', '/etc/pki/tls/private/']
#config_opts['ssl_extra_certs'] = ['/path/on/host', '/path/in/mock/chroot',
#                                  '/path/on/host2', '/path/in/mock/chroot2', ... ]
```

It copies the host's SSL certificates into a specified location inside the chroot if
mock needs access to repositories requiring client certificate
authentication. Specify the full path to the public certificate on the host
and the destination directory in the chroot. Do the same for the private key.
The private key should not be password-protected if you want Mock to run
unattended. 

This is the last 2.x release made from `main` branch. After this release, we
will create a new branch, and future 2.x versions will get only important bug
fixes and important changes to the config.

A version in `main` will be 3.x and will stop supporting EL7 as *host*. This
will allow us to get rid of some compatibility code. However, we will still
support building **for** EL7.

We plan to build 3.x for Fedora 35+ and EPEL 9+ (and after a few releases for
EPEL 8 too). Fedora 34 and EPEL 7 will stay on 2.x version.
